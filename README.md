## Database Setup/Migration

* Run MySQL by entering ```mysql -uroot -pepicodus``` in the terminal (In this example, 'epicodus' is the password, so if the word `password` was your password then you'd have ```msql -uroot -ppassword```)

* This can be found in the MySql Workbench `Server` menu as `Data Import`, then choose `Import from Self-Contained File`.  Use the browsing tool to select the `taylor_phillips.sql` file that is included with the project and finally select `Start Import`.

-->Put Gif tutorial here if time<--
* Within the project file, `appsettings.json` you will need to be sure that the password (pwd) matches the password that you are using for your MySql Workbench.
